Hello

HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:

-> open event.txt
-> Type the eventname, tickets available and unit cost of a ticket in this format:
    
        EVENTNAME;TOTALTICKETS;UNITCOST
        
        Example: THE GREAT CIRCUS;2000;150
        
-> launch start.py via terminal and follow the onscreen instructions

-> To take a look at the log of tickets sold, open tickets.txt

-> NOTE:
    RESET option in start.py resets the inventory and log
    to AVOID RESET simply choose END SESSION
