# Method to do Radix Sort 
def radixSort(arr): 
  
    # Find the maximum number to know number of digits 
    max1 = max(arr) 
  
    # Do counting sort for every digit. Note that instead 
    # of passing digit number, exp is passed. exp is 10^i 
    # where i is current digit number 
    exp = 1
    while max1/exp > 0: 
        countingSort(arr,exp) 
        exp *= 10
